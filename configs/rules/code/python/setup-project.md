# Python: Project Setup

How to set up a Python project, from package manager and `pyproject.toml` through type checking and pytest.

---

## Structure

```text
<project>/
├── pyproject.toml
├── README.md
├── src/
│   └── <package>/  # reusable library logic; installable as a package
│       └── __init__.py
├── scripts/  # entry-point scripts
└── utests/  # unit tests
```

- Keep `scripts/` and `src/<package>/` separate from the start.
- `scripts/` holds entry points; `src/<package>/` holds reusable logic.

---

## Package Manager

uv is used for all Python package and project management.

Initialise a new project:

```bash
uv init <project-name>
```

Common commands:

| Command | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `uv add <package>` | add a runtime dependency |
| `uv add --group dev <package>` | add to the dev dependency group |
| `uv sync` | install all dependencies from the lockfile |
| `uv run <command>` | run a command in the project environment |
| `uv lock` | regenerate the lockfile |

Always use `uv run` rather than activating the virtual environment manually.

## pyproject.toml

Metadata fields follow this order:

```toml
[project]
name = "project-name"
version = "0.1.0"
description = "..."
readme = "README.md"
authors = [{ name = "<name>", email = "<email>" }]
requires-python = ">=3.11"
dependencies = [...]
```

Dev dependencies go in a dependency group:

```toml
[dependency-groups]
dev = [
    "pytest>=9.0.2",
]
```

For editable local library dependencies, see [`setup-module.md`](setup-module.md).

## Type Checking

Use basedpyright (not mypy, not pyright). Include all relevant source and test directories. Suppressed rules must have an inline comment explaining why. The suppression list below is a menu of acceptable suppressions, not a block to copy wholesale; only add suppressions that are needed for the project after first trying to fix the code:

```toml
[tool.pyright]
include = ["src", "utests", "vtests"]
extraPaths = ["src"]

## --- rules to enforce
reportMissingImports = true
reportMissingTypeStubs = false  # third-party packages rarely ship stubs

## --- rules to suppress
## Add only the suppressions that this project actually needs.
reportExplicitAny = "none"  # numpy/scipy code uses Any extensively; unavoidable
reportAny = "none"  # noisy cascade of the above
reportUnknownMemberType = "none"  # cascade from untyped third-party stubs
reportUnknownVariableType = "none"  # cascade from untyped third-party stubs
reportUnknownArgumentType = "none"  # cascade from untyped third-party stubs
reportImplicitStringConcatenation = "none"  # valid style for long error messages
reportImplicitOverride = "none"  # too verbose to require @override on every override
reportUnusedCallResult = "none"  # ensure_*/check_* are called for side effects
reportPrivateUsage = "none"  # tests legitimately access private members
reportUninitializedInstanceVariable = "none"  # false positive: pyright misses variables set in setUp()
enableTypeIgnoreComments = true  # honour "# type: ignore" (basedpyright defaults to false)
reportIgnoreCommentWithoutRule = "none"  # test files use bare "# type: ignore" intentionally
reportUnnecessaryTypeIgnoreComment = "none"  # suppress warnings about stale ignore comments
reportUnnecessaryIsInstance = "none"  # isinstance guards for runtime safety beyond what annotations enforce
reportUnreachable = "none"  # paired with the above: guards after exhaustive isinstance chains appear unreachable to pyright
```

---

## pytest

Configure pytest with the src layout in mind:

```toml
[tool.pytest.ini_options]
pythonpath = ["src"]
testpaths = ["utests"]
```

---

## Maintenance

Run after any Python or metadata change:

```bash
uv run basedpyright
```

```bash
uv run python -m py_compile <python-file> <package-dir>/*.py
```
