# Rules

The `~/.rules/` system: what it is, what belongs in it, and how to add, extend, and promote rules.

---

## What it is

The canonical source is `~/Projects/DotFiles/configs/rules/`. All `.md` files there are symlinked into `~/.rules/` by `uv run -m scripts.setup.rules_files` run from the DotFiles repo. Edit the source; never edit through a symlink.

## Structure

```text
~/.rules/
├── dev/  # conventions for producing code and scripts
│   ├── python/  # Python language bundle
│   └── quokka/  # Quokka project bundle
├── writing/  # conventions for producing text
└── workflow/  # conventions for how to work
    └── notes/  # this bundle
```

## What belongs here

A rule belongs in `~/.rules/` when it is a binding convention: it applies across future uses of a tool, language, or context, and it prescribes how to do something.

| Belongs in `~/.rules/` | Does not belong |
|---|---|
| How to write a docstring | What a specific function does |
| Commit message format | Status of an ongoing investigation |
| Agent collaboration modes | HPC machine hardware specs |
| File and folder naming conventions | Lessons learned from a specific simulation run |

When in doubt: a rule answers "what is the convention?" A note answers "what is known?". See `README.md` in this bundle for the full decision rubric.

## Adding a rule

1. Find the right file. Read `~/.rules/README.md` for the full index. Use an existing file if the topic fits; create a new one if nothing covers it.
2. Edit the source under `~/Projects/DotFiles/configs/rules/`.
3. From `~/Projects/DotFiles/`, run `uv run -m scripts.setup.rules_files` to relink and `uv run -m scripts.setup.rules_index` to regenerate the index.
4. Commit following `workflow/git.md`.

**New file:** name it `<concept>.md`; one word or a short phrase naming the subject. Open with a title and a one-line description so the map entry is meaningful.

**Promoting a file to a bundle:** when a single file grows to cover sub-topics that each warrant their own section, convert it to a subdirectory. Create a `README.md` inside it for any context that applies to the bundle as a whole, and split the content into per-topic files.

**New bundle:** when the concept is large from the start, create the subdirectory directly. Add a `README.md` if there is bundle-level context to capture. Follow the existing bundle pattern in `code/python/` or `code/quokka/`.

## Promoting a finding

A finding in the notes system becomes a rule when it can be stated as "always X" or "never Y" and applies to future work, not just to the instance that produced it.

To promote:

1. Identify which `~/.rules/` file the convention belongs in.
2. Phrase it as a rule: prescriptive, not descriptive.
3. In the notes source, note the promotion if the investigation entry is still live. The rule itself carries no back-reference.
4. Commit following `workflow/git.md`.
